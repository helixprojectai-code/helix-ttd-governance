# helix-ttd-governance
Custody-first governance for Helix-TTD — charter, params, and proposal scaffolds with anti-capture and anti-bureaucracy guardrails.

FACT: This repo houses Helix-TTD’s custody-first governance: the DAO Charter, parameter registry, schemas, and example proposals. 

HYPOTHESIS: A minimal, milestone-only proof process plus decisive-margin checks for the Chair and CLS balances speed with capture resistance. 

ASSUMPTION: Initial caps/thresholds are conservative and will be tuned post-genesis with observed data.
